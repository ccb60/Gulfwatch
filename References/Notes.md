# Toxicity Benchmarks for Shellfish

EPA. 2000. "Guidance for Assessing
Chemical Contaminant Data for Use in Fish Advisories
Volume 2
Risk Assessment and Fish Consumption Limits
Third Edition

Table 5-2 gives "Toxicity Equivalency Factors" for PAHs.

In general, risk levelsare expressed in terms of daily doses in mg/kg-d
Several individual PAHs have established reference dodes (RfDs), but confidence in those levels is low.

NOAELs are sometimes also available, but not offered here.

Values for individual PAHs tend to hover around 10^-2 t0 10^-1 mg/kg or slightly higher 

But I can't go from those to acceptable levels in shellfish without estimating size of shellfish meats, size of human, etc.

-----------------------------------
We can guestimate, based on information found from unverifiable sources on-line:
One pound of mussels (let's call it 500gms) is ~ 20 to 25 animals, and a fairly typical serving.  It might have on the order of 20% meat, so total consumed meat in a serving might be on the order of 100g.

Maine:  An Encyclopedia" (https://maineanencyclopedia.com/blue-mussel-harvests/)suggests meat averages about 17% of weight of whole mussels in Maine.

so, if a 60 kg ( ~ 130 lb) human consumed a regular serving

dose == conc in ng/g / 1000mg/ng * 100 g / (60kg *1000g/kg)

we're seeing total PAH concentrations in the most contaminated samples from Portland Harbor on theorder of 11500 ng.g, so
