# Introduction
The Gulfwatch data was downloaded in annual files, but data from Casc oBay was
not collected in every year. This preliminary script identifies which files
contain Casco Bay related data and moves all files that do not contain Casco Bay
data into a sub-folder.  This simplified access to files in the data access
scripts.

```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)

```

# Site Codes
Data in each file indicates locations of samples either with a site code (most data) or with a site name (most metals data).
```{r site_codes}
sitecodes <- c('MEPH', 'MEPR', 'MEBC', 'MERY')
sitenames <- c('Portland Harbor', 'Presumpscot River',
               'Broad Cove', 'Royal River')
```


# Load Data
## Establish Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
sibfldnm <- 'Original_Data'
parent   <- dirname(getwd())
sibling  <- file.path(parent,sibfldnm)
niecefn = 'Gulfwatch'
niece = file.path(sibling, niecefn)
```


```{r filenames}
(fnlist <- list.files(niece, pattern = '^(metal|pah|pcb|pest)'))
```
#  Search Files to Find Casco Bay Data
## Assemble REGEX Patterns
```{r regex_patterns}
sitecodepattern = ''
sitecodepattern <- paste0(sitecodepattern, paste(sitecodes, collapse = '|' ))
sitecodepattern

sitenamepattern = ''
sitenamepattern <- paste0(sitenamepattern, paste(sitenames, collapse = '|' ))
sitenamepattern
```

## Identify Files we Need
The following could probably be managed with functional programming / vectorized code instead of for loops.  It makes little difference here, since the time consuming steps are opening files and searching.

Also, note that the list of files that do NOT contain Casco Bay data is empty after this notebook is run for the first time.
```{r identify_files} 
res <- logical(length(fnlist))
for (index in seq_along(fnlist)) {
    lns <- read_lines(file.path(niece,fnlist[index]))
    res[index] <- (any(grepl(sitecodepattern, lns)) | any(grepl(sitenamepattern, lns)))
}
(files_with_CB_data <- fnlist[res])
cat('\n\n')
(files_wo_CB_data <- fnlist[! res])
```

## Move Files We Don't Need
We place the  data files that do not contain Casco Bay Data into the "Unused" folder.

```{r move_files}
from <- file.path(niece, files_wo_CB_data)
to   <- file.path(niece, 'Unused', files_wo_CB_data)
fs::file_move(from, to)

```
