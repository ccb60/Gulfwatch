# Overview
*  Pesticide files are organized with Parameters (pesticides) in rows, and Sites in columns. 
*  As for the other Gulfwatch data, files prior to 1998 are organized in blocks,
not one continuous table. 
*  All sample values are in ng/g dry weight.  
*  Non-detects are abundant, and  are shown as "<{value}".  
*  Each block of sample data is followed by a related block containing data on
"Surrogate" (presumably recovery) expressed in percent.  Most source tables 
show no information on what the surrogate was except in 1999, when it is
identified as g-Chlordene.  In 2000 no Surrogate data was provided, but the 
worksheet has the annotation "IN = Interference", suggesting a problem.
*  A sample from Broad Cove in 1995 appears to have two sets of values combined
in a a single column, separated by a slash ("/").  We split the two values out
as replicates, probably laboratory replicates.  
* MEPR-1N, from 2000 has an extraneous "<1.2" in a row that should not contain
any data.  We deleted it it.
* Nomenclature of pesticides differs slightly between years.  Order appears
to be consistent.  Most changes in nomenclature reflect differences in
punctuation or spacing, and obviously refer to the same compound. Only one pair
of names showed more significant inconsistencies. Data from 1993 and 1994 refers
to "r-BHC" which probably refers to benzene hexachloride, commonly known as
Lindane. In 1995, the same row in the data table is labeled with "g-HCH", which
probably refers to Î³-Hexachlorocyclohexane, which is a synonym.

## Data Reorganization in Excel
With all those exceptions and considerations, it was simpler to reorganize
these data by hand in Excel, rather than try to write code to extract data
in a readily reproducible way.

Reorganization involved:
1. pooling data from multiple files;
2. deleting data from sampling locations outside of Casco Bay;
4. adding sample identification data ( site code, year, and sample type); and
5. Revising the Pesticide Names to generate syntactic names for R.

We retained both sample analysis data and data on "Surrogate Recovery" for each
sample, but in separate files to simplify analysis.

The reorganized sample data is contained in 'gulfwatch_pest_Casco.csv' and the
percent recovery data is in 'gulfwatch_pest_Casco_pct_recovery.csv'.

These data require further processing in R, especially to handle non-detects. 
We begin that processing here, and continue it in the accompanying Notebook
"Calculate_Gulfwatch_PCB_Totals.Rmd".

Following CBEP convention, we split data columns containing non-detects into two
data columns, one containing numeric values (either sample observations or
detection limits), and the other containing a logical flag that indicates
which values are non-detects.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)

```


# Site Codes
Data in each file indicates locations of samples either with a site code (most data) or with a site name (most metals data).
```{r site_codes}
sitecodes <- c('MEPH', 'MEPR', 'MEBC', 'MERY')
sitenames <- c('Portland Harbor', 'Presumpscot River',
               'Broad Cove', 'Royal River')
```

# Load Data
```{r load_data}
fn     <- 'gulfwatch_pest_Casco.csv'
pest_data <- read_csv(fn)
```

## Convert to Long Form
```{r long_form}
pest_data_longer <- pest_data %>% pivot_longer(cols = HCB:Total,
                                             names_to = 'Pesticide',
                                             values_to = 'Original')
```

## Split  Columns 
Into the numerical value and a ND flag
```{r split_columns}
pest_data_working <- pest_data_longer %>%
  mutate(Flag = Original == 'ND' | grepl('<', Original),
         Concentration = if_else(Flag,
                                 as.numeric(substr(Original, 2,nchar(Original))),
                                 as.numeric(Original))) %>%
  select (-Original)
  
```

## Save Result
```{r save_long_data}
write_csv(pest_data_working, 'gulfwatch_pest_data_long.csv')
```
