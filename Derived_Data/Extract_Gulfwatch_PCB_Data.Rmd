# Overview
*  PCB files are organized with Parameters (PCBs) in rows, and Sites in columns. 
*  As for the other Gulfwatch data, files prior to 1998 are organized in blocks,
not one continuous table. 
*  PCBs are identified by congener number, sometimes separated by a semicolon 
when more than one congener is reported on a given line. Nomenclature and a
crosswalk to other ways of naming compounds are provided in the Excel file
"PCB_Nomenclature.xlsx".  As our primary focus will be on TOTAL PCBs,
nomenclature is not critical.  
*  All sample values are in ng/g dry weight.  
*  Non-detects are abundant, and  are shown as "<{value}".  
*  Each block of sample data is followed by a related block containing data on
"Surrogate Recovery" expressed in percent.  Recoveries vary substantially.  
*  Although four samples were analyzed from the Royal River in 1993 for metals,
only three were analyzed for PCBs. 
*  A sample from Broad Cove in 1995 appears to have two sets of values combined
in a a single column, separated by a slash ("/").  We split the two values out
as replicates.  We do not know if these are field replicates or laboratory
replicates.  
*  A duplicate sample in 1999 was not assigned to a specific sample. By context
that appears to be a laboratory duplicate (but that is not clearly defined).
There is no indication of which primary sample it duplicates (if any). IN the
other data files, teh duplicate sample is assigned to the MERY 4 sample.
* The PCB data for 2000 included two rows listed as PCB 87.  By context, the 
second one Probably should have been PCB 187.
*  Percent lipid data was provided for 1999 data only, and is dropped here for 
consistency with other years.
* The percent recovery figure for PCB 198 in 1999 is listed as "IN" for
interference.

## Data Reorganization in Excel
With all those exceptions and considerations, it was simpler to reorganize these data by hand in Excel, rather than try to write code to extract data in a readily reproducible way.

Reorganization involved:
1. pooling data from multiple files;
2. deleting data from sampling locations outside of Casco Bay;
3. establishing consistent ordering of PCBs
4. adding sample identification data ( site code, year, and sample type); and
5. Revising the numeric PCB Codes to generate syntactic names for R. Names start
with "PCB_" followed by one or two PCB congener numbers, separated by
underscores.

We retained both sample analysis data and data on "Surrogate Recovery" for each
sample, but in separate files to simplify analysis.

The reorganized sample data is contained in 'gulfwatch_pcb_Casco.csv' and the
percent recovery data is in 'gulfwatch_pcb_Casco_pct_recovery.csv'.

These data require further processing in R, especially to handle non-detects. 
We begin that processing here, and continue it in the accompanying Notebook
"Calculate_Gulfwatch_PCB_Totals.Rmd".

Following CBEP convention, we split data columns containing non-detects into two
data columns, one containing numeric values (either sample observations or
detection limits), and the other containing a logical flag that indicates
which values are non-detects.

# Load Libraries
```{r load_libraries}
library(tidyverse)

```


# Site Codes
Data in each file indicates locations of samples either with a site code (most data) or with a site name (most metals data).
```{r site_codes}
sitecodes <- c('MEPH', 'MEPR', 'MEBC', 'MERY')
sitenames <- c('Portland Harbor', 'Presumpscot River',
               'Broad Cove', 'Royal River')
```

# Load Data
```{r load_data}
fn     <- 'gulfwatch_pcb_Casco.csv'
pcb_data <- read_csv(fn)
```

## Convert to Long Form
```{r long_form}
pcb_data_longer <- pcb_data %>% pivot_longer(cols = PCB_8_5:Total,
                                             names_to = 'PCB',
                                             values_to = 'Original')
```

## Split  Columns 
Into the numerical value and a ND flag
```{r split_columns}
pcb_data_working <- pcb_data_longer %>%
  mutate(Flag = Original == 'ND' | grepl('<', Original),
         Concentration = if_else(Flag,
                                 as.numeric(substr(Original, 2,nchar(Original))),
                                 as.numeric(Original))) %>%
  select (-Original)
  
```

## Save Result
```{r save_long_data}
write_csv(pcb_data_working, 'gulfwatch_pcb_data_long.csv')
```
