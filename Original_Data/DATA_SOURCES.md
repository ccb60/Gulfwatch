File format is unfortunate for automated data reorganization, and is not consistent across years or parameters.

Casco Bay sites are not sampled in every year.

## Sample Locations
Downloaded November 25, 2019 by Curtis C. Bohlen
Data on sample locations is not linked to the "findings" page where the other data is available, but it can be found on the program home page:
https://gulfofmaine.org/public/gulfwatch-contaminants-monitoring/ (Note that Download Links on this page take you to the same table of downloadable files accessed above).

Unfortunately, the metadata there does not provide data on the geoid used for determining latitude and longitude. We have to make an assumption, and we went with WGS 1984.

## Metadata
In general, the data as provided is not accompanied by metadata.  To ensure we are analyzing the data appropriately, we consulted data reports provided [here](https://gulfofmaine.org/public/gulfwatch-contaminants-monitoring/data-reports/).
